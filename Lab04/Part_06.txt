Creating a file and putting content into it.
  I am going to learn exciting tool. 
  This content is being created in Linux using "touch", "vi"...
  Save the file and view it in both cat and less
  Go back into the file in vi and enter some more content. 
  It's not weird, i always though Linux is unecessary but it's fun.
  But does this has grammarly because i do lot of spelling mistake while typing! just kidding and curious.
